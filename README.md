Cmpt 276 Group Project ideas

Meeting 1  (Feb 2, 2024): 
Ideas: 
App that locates disabled washrooms

List of food banks: 
Greater vancouver food bank
Sources food bank 
Surrey food bank 

App for greater van food bank ideas: 
2 options for login: donator or receiver 
Receivers can login and access a “wishlist”

Meeting 2  (Feb 7, 2024): 
Questions: 
How should we verify whether the product is received
What do we do if some items on an order are missing even if it says its complete 
Our app’s logistics: 
We select what products are available to the users, and they can choose what they want 
The donor selects what products they want to purchase/donate, and they are responsible for bringing it into the food bank (no online transaction on our end) 
There is a max number of items for receiver wishlists, since donors have to purchase a whole wishlist 
It would be to expensive for donors if there is an unlimited amount of items on a wishlist 
Plan for next meeting: 
Have the base/idea of the application 
Decide what roles each person will have 
More of how we will make the functions/code


Proposal questions to answer: 
Do we have a clear understanding of the problem?
What is the name of your web application?

How is this problem solved currently (if at all)?
The Surrey food bank has a link to an amazon wishlist where donors can enter what they want accessible at the food bank. However, they don’t have an option for people to request items.  The donor chooses what items they want to donate.  


How will this project make life better? Is it educational or just for entertainment?
Our project is a personalized approach to food banks, allowing users to request their own necessities.  By allowing them to request the items they need, it provides a convenient way for food bank users to get a chance to have a say in selecting the specific items they need, which is something the current food banks don’t have. 


Who is the target audience? Who will use your app or play your game?
People at an economic disadvantage or lower income. The users would be those that use food banks, and those who would like to help out the community who would like to donate food items. 


What is the scope of your project?
Does this project have many individual features or one main feature (a possibility with many subproblems)? These are the ‘epics’ of your project.
There are two options for signing up and creating an account would be for donors and for the receivers. One option allows users to request necessary items in an approach similar to the Amazon storefront wish list. The second option would allow users to donate money or request to donate that specific item off of the receiver’s wish list.


What are some sample stories/scenarios? For example, as a regular user of your site, what types of things can I do?  These are the ‘stories’ of your project.
Scenario 1: receiver
A mother from a lower income family needs to buy groceries for her children, but she can not afford it.  So she goes to our website and selects the register option to create her account so she can create a new wishlist of groceries to feed her family. There is a menu to select which location she would like to pick items up from. Afterwards, she is presented with some categories of items (ex canned goods, breads, cereals,etc) where she can select the items that she needs, which get added to her wish list. There is also a search bar available for easier search. She gets a limit of 15 items per list. The items she selects are added to a checklist and she can wait until she receives a notification that her items are ready for pick up. 


Scenario 2: donor 
	Someone wants to give back to their community by donating to a food bank, so they login to our application.  They login as a donor, where they can browse individual people’s grocery wishlists. Once they viewed as many wish lists as they wanted, they can click the select button and are responsible for donating the items from that order. After they bring the items to that food bank location, a notification gets sent to the receiver of the items that their order is ready for pickup. .


Be honest, is the amount of work required in this proposal enough for five group members
Yes, there is enough work for all of us.
