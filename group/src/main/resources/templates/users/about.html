        <h2>Why are clothing and toy drives needed?</h2>
        <p>By donating toys and gently wore clothing items, not only does it provide a second life for used items,
            but can significantly impact a child's life. There are thousands of children nationwide who do not have the means
            to afford toys and/or clothing items. By sending your donations to ChildHelp, you are bringing joy and happiness to
            our children in need.</p>

                <p>Why I’m Here: For over 50 years I have seen miracles take place when a child is rescued with love, nurtured with care and inspired by hope. I believe every child deserves the right to be free from abuse and neglect in order to reach his or her ultimate potential. Childhelp changes lives and we are honored to have shepherded millions of children to safety with God’s help.</p>

                <p>Why I’m Here: It is impossible to look in the eyes of a child in need and do nothing. In 1959 Sara and I discovered a group of orphans that touched our hearts and we continue to be inspired by the little lives we encounter through this mission of light and love.</p>
