        <h1>Making an impact with the Childhelp Speak Up Be Safe program</h1><br>
        <p>In FY23, the Childhelp Tennessee Child Advocacy Center in Knoxville was awarded a grant to promote child
            abuse prevention education in Knox County. Through the addition of a Childhelp Speak Up Be Safe trainer,
            tremendous success was achieved in raising awareness throughout Knox County and successfully
            implementing Childhelp Speak Up Be Safe into classrooms and other community settings. FY24 is looking to
            have an even bigger reach in Knox County through these efforts.</p>

        <h2>Childhelp foster care donations system</h2>
        <p>In 1982, although child abuse had received some media and political attention already, Sara Oâ€™Meara and Yvonne Fedderson (Childhelp Founders) were determined to continue the fight against child abuse. Every time they were able to look into the eyes of a child the organization saved, it was only a reminder of all the other children that still needed their help.Thousands of children in need and our foster care facilities and organizations were provided with gently used clothing and toy donations.</p>
